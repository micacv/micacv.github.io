									Software Engineer Intern at VMware, Santa Monica, CA <br>
									June 2020 - August 2020
								</p>
								<p> This past summer, I interned at VMware, where I was part of the Tanzu Application Service (TAS) program, Release Engineering team where I worked on automating continuous delivery for TAS products in an agile environment. I also got the opportunity to largely work and contribute to a project to automate dependencies management. At the time of my internship, the TAS program was going through the transition of switching to Kubernetes from BOSH, an open-source tool for lifecycle and deployment management, and I worked on the test pipeline for deploying TAS for Kubernetes on different cloud environments. I also maintained source code repositories and CI/CD pipelines daily, dealt with bugs, and software improvements.

									June 2019 - August 2019
								</p>
								<p> I interned at Becoming Machinic Inc. after my Sophmore year at College. I worked on an open-source project, where I designed and implemented continuous integration and deployment build server as RestAPI in Java to optimize the development. I assisted in developing new and improving existing software solution in the Agile environment. I also occasionally worked on preparing security reports which documented identified vulnerabilities and the extent of damage caused by breaches.

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hello! My name is Milica Cvrkota. I’m a native Serbian and currently based in Iowa, where I am attending Grinnell College and pursuing a BA degree in Computer Science. I developed my interests in computing in High School, where I prospered my problem-solving skills and was introduced to functional programming for the first time. I further developed the passion in college after studying careful problem analysis, evaluation, and prediction of the algorithm behavior and the presence of this profession in every industry and daily life made this field even more appealing.  </p>
								<p>Besides my primary focus on software development, I am also pursuing my interest in the arts, environmental studies, and women’s rights at Grinnell. I have the ambition of excelling in academia, and ultimately exceeding that objective by becoming a software developer and improving the underrepresentation of women in computing. In my free time, I also enjoy hiking, snowboarding, traveling, and photography.
