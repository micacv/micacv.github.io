								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hello! My name is Milica Cvrkota. I’m originally from Serbia, and I am currently based in Stuttgart, Germany, where I am working as Backend Cloud Software Engineer at IBM. In December 2020, I completed my BA degree in Computer Science at Grinnell College in Iowa. I developed my interests in computing in High School, where I prospered my problem-solving skills and was introduced to functional programming for the first time. I further developed the passion in college after studying careful problem analysis, evaluation, and prediction of the algorithm behavior and the presence of this profession in every industry and daily life made this field even more appealing.  </p>
								<p>Besides my primary focus on software development, I also pursued my interest in the arts, environmental studies, and women’s rights at Grinnell College. My ambition is to make a positive impact through my work and to work towards improving the underrepresentation of women in computing. I also enjoy hiking, snowboarding, traveling, and since recently, cooking in my free time.
